Memory Game Project This is a simple memory game project built using C# and WPF, designed to enhance my programming skills through practical application. The project demonstrates basic game mechanics and WPF design principles.

Project Overview The game involves flipping cards and matching pairs. It utilizes several key classes that handle different aspects of the game’s functionality and design:

How to Navigate the Project This section describes the roles of each class in the project:

-BackSideCard: Defines the appearance and properties of the back of the cards used in the game.

-FrontSideCard: Defines the appearance and properties of the front of the cards used in the game.

-CardFlippingManager: Contains the core logic for managing card interactions, such as verifying matches, blocking actions during flips, and tracking flipped cards.

-FlippingCard: Implements the card flip animation and visual aspects, integrating the front and back sides of each card.

-FourxThreeGamePanel: Manages the main gameplay interface, including the random assignment of images to cards, handling end-of-game states, resetting the game, and managing player turns and scores.

-MainWindow: The main entry point of the application, featuring the game’s main menu and navigation to other screens, such as the game panel and rules.

-MenuPanel: A placeholder class that is not currently utilized within the project.
