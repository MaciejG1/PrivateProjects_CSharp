Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe application developed using C# and WPF. The primary goal of this project is to explore the basics of WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and understand how to build desktop applications using this technology.

Project Overview
The application implements a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Features
Two-player gameplay: The game allows two players to compete against each other on the same device.
Basic UI: The application has a simple and clean user interface to provide a straightforward user experience.
Game Logic: Handles turns, checks for winning conditions, and manages game resets.

Technology Stack
C#
WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)

Project Structure
The project consists of a single class:
-MainWindow.xaml: Defines the layout and UI components of the application, such as the game board and buttons.
-MainWindow.xaml.cs: Contains the logic for managing the game, including:
  >Player turns and move validation.
  >Checking for win conditions and draw states.
  >Handling game resets and updating the UI accordingly.

Learning Objectives
